[Verse 1]
I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track. (Thunder)
I looked round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought what could I do (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)

[Chorus]
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart
You've been - thunderstruck

[Verse 2]
Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to the Texas, yeah Texas
And we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

[Chorus]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah the ladies were too kind
You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah yeah yeah, thunderstruck

[Bridge]
Oh, thunderstruck
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Now we're shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?

[Bridge]
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah yeah yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Said yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
(So fine)

[Outro]
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Whoa baby, baby, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck"
